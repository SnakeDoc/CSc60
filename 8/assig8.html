<h3>What is Shared Memory IPC?</h3>
<ol>
<li>
A shared memory service is an IPC method the OS provides to allocated
a segment of memory that can be directly accessed by multiple processes
- similar to global data accessible by multiple threads running in a single
process. Memory sharing is a simple idea, easy to understand, and favorable
to the access speed. The drawbacks are: 1, it is not immune to racing
conditions; and 2, it is still restricted within a single host, not over
a separate host on a computer network.
<p>
<li>
As illustrated in example folders, the server (parent) process requests
<i>shared memory segments</i> via <tt>semget()</tt> syscalls in which
a <i>key_t key</i> (an integer) and a size (in bytes) are needed. The OS
will then allocate the sharable memory and return a <i>memory ID</i>
to be used in another syscall <tt>shmat()</tt> to attach the memory to a
local character pointer or be type-cast to other types defined in programs.
Subsequent read/write operations are then done via the pointer.
<p>
<li>
To close (return) the allocated shared-memory segment, the original process
that requested it should issue a <tt>shmctl()</tt> syscall with the memory
ID in the arguments.
<p>
<li>
In this assignment each alphabet process updates its current column position
in the shared memory (and sleep for a period), the server process loops to
read each position (without sleep). So, updated positions will be read
correctly.  Therefore, with a semaphore to control the data access between
each alphabet and server processes is not needed. (Using semaphores does not
change the outcome.) Therefore, only the video semaphore is needed.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>Assignment Description</h3>
<ol>
<li>
In the assignment folder, the example folders demonstrate syscalls to
<i>request</i> segments of shared memory and <i>attach</i> them among
processes.
<p>
<li>
Shared memory segments should be reguested by the server process and
given to alphabet processes to use. Each alphabet process can thus know
the information it needs. Each alphabet process also updates its current
column position into the shared-memory segment for the server to read.
<p>
<li>
Copy and run the <i>minimum</i> demo. The runtime of your programs must
match the demo which is very similar to the previous assignment, except
that the server process, after creating all alphabets, should proceed to
another loop to read their column positions. And, as each alphabet reaches
the finish line, the server displays a placement number at the rightmost
column on the row of that alphabet. The top 5 places have an extra 3
asterisk symbols displayed after the number. The server ends this loop
when all 26 alphabet processes have reached the finish line.
<p>
<li>
No message passing is used. Use the shared-memory IPC for all information
exchanges, and there is a single semaphore for video display.
<p>
<li>
See the <i>extra-credit</i> demo. An extra credit (2 points) to incorporate
a <tt>client.c</tt> program that can display/view the progress of the race
from a different terminal. The <i>client</i> first draws out the finish-line
dots and then loop to access the shared memory to update the display to follow
the progress of the race.
In order to pass the shared-memory ID, use shell command <tt>./client (shared
memory ID)</tt> (so the ID will be in the string form of <i>argv[1]</i>).
<p>
<li>
See the <i>extra-credit-2</i> demo for a level-2 extra credit (another 2
points), which first lets the client pick a winner via a <tt>keypoll</tt>
process. The picked letter is displayed on the client site (the "GOOD LUCK"
message) and passed to the server process via the shared memory. The server
will then start the race, and at the end the server returns the result of
the points won or lose, and the client site displays that number. The logical
rationale of a game play like this is that there can be multiple clients (so
each deals its local notifications to display), and the single server does
all the point calculations and return them.
<p>
<li>
The program <i>keypoll.c</i> has its own "include" statements and exits
with the ASCII number of the picked alphabet. Only a single occurence of
the <tt>wait()</tt> syscall is allowed in all code, and it is for the
client.c to get the picked letter.
<p>
<li>
The shared memory is used to let each of the 26 alphabet processes access
its information: symbol and row number, and semaphore information. The
shared memory is also updated by each alphabet process for its current
column position after displaying its symbol.
<p>
<li>
With viewing the race from a separate shell being the <i>client</i> site,
the race conducted by the server and its alphabet processes constitute the
<i>server</i> site.
<p>
<li>
Do not use any syscalls for IPC signals, pipes, or message passing. The
only "wait-exit" allowed is in the keypoll feature to achieve the level-2
extra credit.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>New System Calls</h3>
<ol>
You will need these new ones (see how they are used in given examples):
<li><ttb>shmget()</tt> to request/allocate a sharable memory segment.
<li><ttb>shmat()</tt> to attach a sharable memory segment onto a local
    <i>char</i> pointer.
<li><tt>shmctl()</tt> to remove a sharable memory segment.
</ol>

<h3>Assignment Turn-in</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Submit your source code the same way as required before in previous
programming assignments. No E-mail will be accepted, no late turn-ins.
<p>
<li>
Place to your designated folder only source files:
<i>server.c, alphabet.c, common.c, common.h, and Makefile</tt> (plus
client.c and keypoll.c for extra credits).</i>
DO NOT put any other files. If repeated submissions, make a new folder
inside this folder and name it <tt>V2</tt> (version 2), <tt>V3</tt>, etc.
<p>
<li>
Clean up your code with a clean format, preamble header, and comments
where suited (and can help the grader to understand your code). Do not
mess with your code since it may cause point deduction.
<p>
