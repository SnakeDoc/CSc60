Assignment 1, C Pointers, CSc 60, Fall 2014

3 programs about C pointers need to be understood, like
3 questions Q1, Q2, and Q3:
   Q1. ptr0.c (target variables: i, j, p, q, and r)
   Q2. ptr1.c (target variables: p, q, and array x in main())
   Q3. ptr2.c (target variables: i, j, and p in main())

Please use apply the 32-bit mode of GCC to compile code, e.g.,
   gcc -m32 ptr0.c

To make sure the size of a pointer is 4 (bytes), try a test.c:
// test.c
   #include <stdio.h>
   main() {
      printf("size of int * is %i\n", sizeof(int *));
   }

Run each of the pointer programs to see and get the output.
Like what's illustrated during class sessions, and in textbook,
draw a diagram with each of the variable memory location as a
rectangle box, and follow the changes in the output to fill out
the boxes as the program statements go.
I.e.,
Follow the sequence of code, draw results whenever a statement
changes the contents of any locations, e.g., label addresses and
fill out boxes whenever box contents get changed.

Example:
   // here.c
   #include <stdio.h>
   main() {
      int a, b, *p;             a                   b                   p
                          addr    content     addr    content     addr    content
                         83357c8 [   ?   ]   83357c4 [   ?   ]   83357c0 [   ?   ]
      a = 5;                     [   5   ]           [   ?   ]           [   ?   ]
      p = &b;                    [   5   ]           [   ?   ]           [83357c4]
      (and so on...)
   }

Turn-in: hard copy, hand-written and drawn, or hand-drawn boxes
mixed with computer printouts is OK.

How to login a Linux host:

Use your ECS network account and Windows "PuTTy" or Mac "terminal" app
to login one of the Linux hosts designated for our assignment usages.

e.g., Mac terminal command: ssh (your username)@atoz.ecs.csus.edu

From off campus you connect to host titan or athena first, then go
to one of the assignment-working host with shell command:
   ssh (your username)@atoz (or sp1/2/3)

Shell command to edit program, e.g., vi my.c
Shell command to compile program: gcc -m32 my.c
Shell command to run program: a.out (or ./a.out if . is not in search path)
