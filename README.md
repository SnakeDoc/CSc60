### CSc 60 - Introduction to System Programming in UNIX

--------------------------------------------------------

- Author: Jason Sipula
- Language: C

Assignments and source code. Probably mistakes, errors, and just generally bad code. ;-P

--------------------------------------------------------

#### WARNING TO ALL STUDENT COPIERS !!!

I've cleverly inserted self destructing timebomb code in various places.

I don't recommend attempting to copy this code, as it may blow up your pc. It did mine...

###### Not to mention you won't learn anything ;)
