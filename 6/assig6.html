<h3>What is a Thread?</h3>
<ol>
<li>
In simple words, a <i>thread</i> is a code thread, a program
module like a separate routine but can be running independently.
Hence, sometimes it is termed a <i>light-weight</i> process.
<p>
<li>
A process can create several threads to run in parallel and they
share the same global-data space. This convenient arrangement
make communication easy. Still, to avoid racing/collision condition
during accessing global data, some synchronization method is needed.
<p>
<li>
Since threads are all within a single process, the code be cannot
distribute over several hosts (as several separate processes).
<p>
<li>
Sample program on how to create threads and use a semaphore to
<i>guard</i> data are illustrated in <a href=ThreadSemaExample>Thread
and Semaphore Example</a>.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>What is a Semaphore?</h3>
<ol>
<li>
A semaphore is like a <i>flag</i> that can be set up to control threads
(or processes) by stopping them or allowing to proceed the next instruction.
<p>
<li>
A semaphore has a <tt>control count</tt></b> that is initially given to
a certain value requested by a process with a syscall <tt>sem_init()</tt>
for inter-thread usage (or <tt>sem_open()</tt> for inter-process usage).
A semaphore ID will be the return of the syscall to be subsequently among
multiple threads (or processes).
<p>
<li>
The syscalls <tt>sem_wait()</tt> and <tt>sem_post()</tt> are the actual
usage of a semaphore. As a thread (or process) calls sem_wait(), the OS
checks if the control count in the semaphore is greater than zero. If so,
the OS downcount it and let the thread (or process) continue (in code).
Otherwise (control count is already at 0), the thread (or process) will
be suspended (put into a waiting queue) until some other thread (or process)
eventually calls sem_post() to release it.
<p>
<li>
As a thread (or process) calls sem_post(), the OS checks if there have
been processes previous suspended (by calling sem_wait() like above) and
If so, the OS releases a waiting process (FIFO) so it can continue within
its code execution. Otherwise (they have been no waiting processes), the
OS will just upcount the control count in the semaphore.
<p>
<li>
If the starting control count of the semaphore was request with 1,
the semaphore acts like a control for <i>mutual exclusion</i> (mutex).
As all threads (or processes) calls sem_wait() and then sem_post() to
synchronize the access of "guarded" critical data between the pair of
syscalls. The example would be racing/collision avoidance over the
access (read/write) of global data among threads.
<p>
<li>
Another way to see how this "mutex" works is that since the control
count starts with 1, it can only be downcounted to 0 and start to
<i>block</i> any new threads (or processes) that come to call sem_wait().
And, the control count can only be count up to 1 (not higher) since each
sem_post() call (upcount) must be preceeded by a sem_wait() call (downcount).
<p>

</ol>

<h3>Display-Cursor Control</h3>
<ol>
In the <a href=CursorControlExample>Cursor Control Example</a> folder, code to
control the location of the display cursor is demonstrated. See below for the
requirement of re-coding from the example code into more useful modular routines.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>Assignment Description</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Write a single program (<tt>CR.c</tt>) that can run like the demo (CR).
Use a single thread as the creations of two running threads: Chaser and Runner.
<p>
<li>
Two semaphores are needed are to guard the use of the display (otherwise,
racing to control cursor will happen) as well as the global data associated
with the current positions of both C and R. The main thread (like a parent)
will also use the semaphore to access the global data to check if a collision
has arrived in order to show the result and end the run.
<p>
<li>
Make useful subroutines listed below to modularize your cursor-control
functions (see the cursor-control example code to do this):
<ol>
<li>PutChar(): show a letter
<li>CursorHome(): position curosr to top-left
<li>CursorOff(): hide cursor
<li>CursorOn(): show (restore) cursor
<li>ClearScr(): clear the whole screen
<li>InitScr(): arrange the box
<li>FlashScr(): flash the scrren
</ol>
<p>
<li>
In the assignment webpage, the <tt>demo</tt> folder has an executable
<tt>CR</tt> (short for Chaser and Runner). When run, they seem to be
animated letter "C" for <i>Chaser</i> and "R" for <i>Runner</i>.
<p>
<li>
A <a href=CR-skeleton.txt>CR skeleton code</a> has the <i>main()</i>
thread (as the parent) that creates two <i>Child</i> threads to each
is give a different pointer to point to their individual information:
<ol>
<li>a single character C or R: <tt>symbol</tt>
<li>initial position coordinate: <tt>row</tt> and <tt>col</tt>
<li>where on the screen to show current position: <tt>show_r</tt>
    and <tt>show_c</tt>
</ol>
<p>
<li>
There will have to be a semaphore <tt>sem_video</tt> to access the
display mutually and exclusively. So, any program statements about
writing to the display should be placed between sem_wait() and sem_post()
syscalls.
<p>
<li>
Similarly, to read/write global data, another semaphore <tt>sem_data</tt>
is needed.
<p>

</ol>

<h3>Extra Credit</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Use processes to do the same CR runs instead. Each process does same
duties like in threads: each child process does its own randomization,
cursor control, show symbol, and show/update its new location as well
as location data. The parent prepare things, create children, monitor
location updates, and show the result and stop the run upon collision.
<p>
<li>
The access to the video (cursor control and print out a character)
needs a semaphore used among processes. The creation and access of
a semaphore in process environment is a little different from threads.
Please see <a href=ProcessSemaExample>Process Semaphore Example</a>.
<li>
<p>
A pipe is needed for data transfers since that is the only channel we
know to enable data transmissions among processes (so far). The parent
creates a shared pipe for child processes to write back their new
positions. The pipe, designated symbol, and initial position are given
to a child process during the process creation (as arguments).
<p>
<li>
The parent will request two more semaphores besides the one for video,
in order to post them (while a child waits on a designated semaphore)
in a round-robin play sequence. Otherwise, one child may play "faster"
than the other. (With multipipes it won't solve this "too fast" issue,
and, still, a semaphore is needed.)
<p>
<li>
Also, with this additional individual semaphore (parent posts, child
waits), the timing to read/write the shared pipe can be done correctly:
A child writes its updated new location information into the pipe during
its turn playing. The parent process reads the pipes knowing which child
the updated information is from. And once a turn is played by both child
processes, compare locations read for collision (in its loop).
</ol>

<h3>Use These Sys/Lib Calls Only</h3>
<ol>
<li>for randomness: <tt>getpid(), srand(), rand()</tt>
<li>for cursor control: <tt>write()</tt>, <tt>strlen()</tt>, <tt>sprintf()</tt>
<li>for delay: <tt>usleep()</tt>
<li>for semaphores: <tt>sem_init(), sem_wait(), sem_post()</tt>
<li>for threads: <tt>pthread_attr_init(), pthread_create()</tt>
<li>use only at the end (show collision): <tt>printf()</tt>
</ol>

<h3>Assignment Turn-in</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Submit your single source code file (CR.3) in the designated folder as before.
No E-mail or late turn-ins. If repeating to submit, use new filenames such as:
CR-2.c, CR-3.c, etc.
<p>
<li>
Clean up your code with a clean format, preamble header, and comments where
suited (and can help the grader to understand your code). Do not mess with your
code and submision location since this may cause point deduction.
</ol>
