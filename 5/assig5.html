<h3>Goal</h3>

<ol>
<li>Always use <tt>gcc -m32 -Wall (source code)</tt> to seek and eliminate
any compiler warnings from now on. The "-Wall" option means "warn-all" possible
errors. This will make good programming practice. From this assignment on,
compiler warnings will cause points deduction during assignment grading.
<p>
<li>The given <tt>doit</tt> shell script is a tool you should use (and modify
it to your own likings). Adding a source-file name (without extension ".c")
and it will compile and name the executable accordingly; e.g., <tt>doit parent</tt>
will use source code "parent.c" to compile into executable "parent."
<p>
<li>Write a C programs parent.c and child.c which performs the same
game-play as described in the previous assignment except that:
the parent will be the one that distributes random values to child
processes through "pipes," an <i>Inter-Process Communication</i> method.
<p>
<li>All child processes will know where to read from the same pipe to
retrieve numbers. There must be some synchronization in order to avoid
"racing" conditions, i.e., whose number is it now in the pipe or whose
turn is it this time to read it to sum?
<p>
<li>A simple way for to distribute numbers via a single pipe to different
destinations: after placing the number in, send a signal to the one that
has the current turn. The child will then read the number and sum via its
own already-registered signal handler. Thus, the same pipe is shared in
the correct round-robin order.
<p>
<li>
And, whenever a child reaches the goal, it exits with the final sum. The
parent, in turns, will catch this event via its ownt signal handler that
handles the event of a child exiting. The parent can than show the result
and tells everyone to quit (including itself).
</ol>

<h3>Details</h3>

<ol>
<li>The parent will first request a <tt>pipe</tt> from the OS. A pipe
is actually like a file/data buffer with two ends: a <i>reading end</i>
to read data from, and a <i>writing end</i> to write data into. System
calls <tt>read</tt> and <tt>write</tt> we used before (to read keyboard
and display) also apply to these two ends (of course, in different file
numbers rather the <i>stdin</i> and <i>stdout</i>).
<p>
<li>
Writing to a pipe does not <i>block</i> the process. Reading, however,
may (similar to reading from the keyboard when nothing typed), if there
aren't data in the pipe. Not enough data for the number of bytes requested
in the <i>read()</i> call does not block, instead, the return number of
the call will be the number of bytes actually read.
<p>
<li>A child, once fork-execl-ed, will have the <i>reading end</i> of
the pipe (in its arguments). The parent uses the <i>writing</i> end of
the pipe. This is a <i>one-way</i> pipe.
<p>
<li>Signals are still be needed in order for a child to read the pipe
at the right time after the parent writes a number into the pipe and
signals it. A child once reaching the goal number will exit with the
sum (for the minimum assignment requirement). The exit event serves
as the signal for the parent to get its result, and stop everyone from
continuing (including itself).
</ol>

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<ol>
<li>Reading a pipe may <i>block</i> the process if there're no data
at all. (Not enough data to match the size of the read request doesn't
block, check the return number from the <i>read()</i> call for the number
of bytes actually read). A pipe <i>buffers</i> data until being read.
A pipe may get too full or become broken -- signal <tt>SIGPIPE</tt>.
<p>
<li>Can using multiple pipes help the parent to distribute numbers
without signaling? That is, if each child is given a private pipe
to read? Can the play turns still be enforced fairly? (They still
use exit calls to return sums.)
<p>
<li>Can using <i>two-way</i> pipes help? This means the parent will
prepare two pipes for each child. The child will write back the
updated sum of its round to the parent which will read and thus
synchronize the play turn. (The parent may be blocked until the
child finishes its current turn, to proceed to the next child.)
<p>
<li>The parent can record the number of rounds and the final sum as
each child reaches the goal, and can thus continue to serve the
rest until all have finished.
<p>
<li>The parent shows all results after all children have done playing.
What is to be show are the child PID and its sum -- in the order of
the original winning sequence during the play loop. (1st-win-1st-recorded,
see the extra-credit demo.)
<p>
<li>As said, <i>reading a pipe</i> may block (when there aren't
any data), and this can actually enforce the orderly round-robin
fair play since the parent will wait for the currently-playing child
to write back after playing its turn, before serving the next child.
<p>
<li>Extra credit (2 points) will be given if no signals are needed when
using two-way pipes as stated above. 
</ol>

<h3>OS Service Calls</h3>
The calls that are allowed to use in code are listed below (signal
calls allowed for minimum/non-extra credit requirement):
<ul>
<li><b>pipe()</b> to request for pipes
<li><b>read()</b> to read from a pipe
<li><b>write()</b> to write to a pipe
<li><b>close()</b> to close a pipe
<li><b>printf()</b> allowed only to show running status
<li><b>atoi()</b> to convert argument strings to numbers
<li><b>sprintf()</b> to build strings to pass as arguments
<li><b>srand()</b> to seed randomization
<li><b>rand()</b> to get a random number
<li><b>exit()</b> (child exits quietly in extra-credit version)
<li><b>wait()</b> (extra-credit part can do without, but an etiquette to receive deaths)
</ul>

<h3>Turn-in</h3>

<ol>
<li>Turn in your source code the same way as you were required to do
for other programming assignments. E-mailing will not be accepted, no
late turn-ins.
<p>
<li>Find folder "5" in the folder of your name, to put your source-code
files (only): parent.c and child.c.
<p>
<li>Write code with a clean format, preamble/header, and put comments
at places that would help with grading (your reasoning).
</ol>
